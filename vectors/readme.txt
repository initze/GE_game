NOTE:

This data was originally prepared by Hugo Ahlenius, Nordpil, between June and August 2009, as the version 1.0 of this database.

Updated to 1.1 in March 2010:
* Corrected a few locations, based on input from Steve Xu, University of Waterloo
* Degraded/round the population estimates, out of respect to the original copyright holder
* Revised license to Creative Commons 0

Data was retrieved from World Urbanization Prospects: The 2007 Revision Population Database (online database), accessed June 8 2009. The population data was related to the ESRI Data & Maps 2008 cities dataset, where names matched, and coordinates for matching cities were retrieved using Hawhts' Tools. Cities not matched were researched using Google Earth and Wikipedia on June 9, 2009, most coordinates were retrieved from the coordinate pages on the latter sources (toolserver/geohack).
The data was rendered as an event layer in ArcGIS, and then exported as a shape file. The exercise was performed using Microsoft Access and Excel, together with ArcGIS and Google Earth Pro. Certain locations were revised/corrected in March 2010 based on input from Steve Xu, University of Waterloo. Out of respect to the original copyright holder, all population figures were also rounded to reduce the precision. Please refer to the original database (World Urbanization Prospects) for full data.
